# Hertz Programming Language

Hertz is a simple, easy-to-learn programming language designed by [Your Name]. It is built to be intuitive and versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications. This repository contains the source code for the Hertz interpreter, written in Python.

## Features
- **Simple Syntax**: Hertz has a clean and minimalistic syntax inspired by languages like Python and JavaScript.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables in Hertz are dynamically typed, making it flexible and easy to use.
- **Interactivity**: The interpreter supports interactive mode, allowing you to run Hertz code line by line.

## Getting Started
To start using Hertz, clone this repository to your local machine and ensure you have Python installed. You can then run the interpreter using the following command:

```bash
python interpreter.py equal.hertz
```

This will launch the Hertz REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), where you can enter and execute Hertz code interactively.

## Examples
Here are some example programs written in Hertz:

```hertz
PRINT "This is New Interpreter for New programming Language by Iamprathameshmore"
PRINT "Enter Your 1st Number"
READ
PRINT "Enter Your 2nd Number"
READ
SUB
JUMP.EQ.0 L1
PRINT "not equal"
HALT

L1:
PRINT "equal"
HALT
```
